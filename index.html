		<h1>How Ramayana Restaurant started</h1>

		<img id="oldie" src="http://hetverhalenarchief.nl/indie-tabee/sites/default/files/contractpensionbennekomfluit.jpg">

		<p>Ramayana Restaurant was started by Balinese-Indonesian husband and wife Putu and Galuh Nyainggolan in 1956. The couple, along with their five children, moved from Denpasar to The Hague to pursue a new life and had the dream to introduce the authentic taste of Indonesian cuisine to the people of the Netherlands. Their five children; Susi, Budi, Laras, Indah and Tuti eventually helped with the day-to-day tasks of running the restaurant.</p>

		<p>They started out with a living room sized establishment within the Zeeheldenkwartier area and eventually expanded their business to the city centre of The Hague on Noordeinde.</p>

		<h1>Where they are now</h1>

		<p>With up to 200 happy customers enjoying Ramayana Restaurant's servings on a daily basis, the restaurant has now been named "Best Indonesian Restaurant of the Netherlands of 2015" by 'EET!' Magazine. They are also available for all catering needs from birthdays to weddings. </p>
		<p> Their restaurant business continues to strive in The Hague and they are planning to expand to the city of Amsterdam in 2017.</p>
